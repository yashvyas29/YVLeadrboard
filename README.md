# YVLeadrboard
YVLeadrboard is a Mobile &amp; Web App that is trying to address the problem for travellers who are new to a city and want to know which are the best 7 restaurants to dine in the city. The same they would also like to know about the Bars &amp; Clubs.

User Logs in the APP using FB. – Data to Fetch are Demographic Profile / Friends on FB who are using the App
See The leadrboard based on City of Current User (Fetched via Location) - Zoom out to State , Country and Continent , World (This can be a List View or Map View) based on the Ranks provided by all the users in the system.
Filters:
1. Location Selection: It can be set to particular city, state, country and world. 2. Category Selection: Restaurant / Bar / Club
3. Review filter : It can be set to 'All users', 'My Friends' or 'Experts'
4. Price range filter : It can be set to ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)
5. Style : It can be set to 'romantic' or 'party'
All these filters will be applied together.
Means, a user might want to have a leaderboard of 'restaurants' of 'Gujarat' which are 'romantic' and has price range '$$$$' while taking into account 'expert' ranks only.
I should also be able to open the Bar in Map view to get directions to if I like to (Future integrations can be to integrate with Uber for Affiliate income)
Clicking on the Bar Name – User should be able to see the details of the Bar like Location, Ranking, Recommendation, and who of my friend has ranked the Bar and what no.
ADD RANK - User searches of Restaurant / Bar / Club by name from an Autocomplete Box (like Google Business Listing) , and clicks on the right one to see the detail of the Restaurant / Bar / Club ( Price Range ($, $$, $$$, $$$$), of Romantic / Party, City ) and then assigns the relevant Rank from 1st – 7th.
